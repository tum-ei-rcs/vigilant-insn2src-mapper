In this folder, we can generate an approximate (but unsafe) WCET library for all functions in libc.
Towards that, create a new subfolder for your target, copy the Makefile from existing ones, 
and adapt the mmcu flag appropriately.

Then, copy the test from the libc sources to there, and run make.

It will generate a file to be used with cbbanalyzer.
